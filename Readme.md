DONE

-ArtistDaoBD does Add, RetrieveAll, Update(edit) and Delete, only missing Retrieve, but that needs to know what var is sent to the method

TO DO

- Check functionality of Vendor Autoload by loading it in Config
- Complete Daos
- See what is better, if passing variables by post or storing the object in session for modifying a deleting
- Build Data Base

- Change Category enum to Class
- Change SteasByEvent enum to Class (load list when program starts)

If Vendor Autoload doesn't work
- Move libraries to "Packages" folder and change the namespaces, deprecate composer
